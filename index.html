        <p class="song">
            I met this girl when I was three years old
            And what I loved most, she had so much soul
            She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
            My name is Windy and I like to blow trees," and
            From that point, I'd never blow her off
            Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
            They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
            And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
            And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
            In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
            I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
            She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
            She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
            Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
            I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
            She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"
